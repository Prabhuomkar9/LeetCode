# Python Solutions

I mostly use python to crack LeetCode problems, you might find many solutions here

On a very low level of computer working, python solutions take up more time and space

This is due to the design of python interpreter and execution of python script

For faster code and more control over your code, Java or C++ is recommended

In case, you wanna scratch your head around the problems, you can definitley try solving the problem thru C
Happy learning there :grin:
